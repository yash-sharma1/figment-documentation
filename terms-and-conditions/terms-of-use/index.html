If the parties to the dispute have not agreed to a settlement of the dispute within 30 days from the date on which the dispute first became known to both parties, then the dispute may be submitted to arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario) in accordance with the following:</p><p>(a) The arbitration tribunal will consist of one arbitrator appointed by mutual agreement of the parties to the dispute, or in the event of failure to agree within 10 Business Days following delivery of the written notice to arbitrate, any party to the dispute may apply to a judge of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice to appoint an arbitrator. The arbitrator must be qualified by education and training to rule upon the particular matter to be decided.</p><p>(b) The arbitrator will be instructed that time is of the essence in the arbitration proceeding and that, in any event, the arbitration award must be made within 30 days of the submission of the dispute to arbitration.</p><p>(c) After written notice is given to refer any dispute to arbitration, the parties will meet within 10 Business Days (days on which banks are open to members of the public in Toronto) of delivery of the notice and negotiate in good faith any changes in these arbitration provisions or the rules of arbitration which are adopted by this section, in an effort to expedite the process and otherwise ensure that the process is appropriate given the nature of the dispute and the values at risk.</p><p>(d) The arbitration will take place in Toronto, Ontario.</p><p>(e) The arbitration award will be given in writing and is final and binding on the parties, not subject to any appeal. The arbitration award will deal with the question of costs of arbitration and all related matters, subject to the remainder of this Section. A party to a dispute may, at any time, make an offer to the other parties to the dispute to settle all or any part of the dispute. Any offer to settle is deemed to be an offer of compromise made in confidence and without prejudice. The fact that an offer to settle has been made may not be communicated to the arbitrator until the arbitrator has made a final determination of all aspects of the dispute other than costs. If an offer to settle is not accepted and the arbitration award is no more favorable to the party to which the offer was made, the party making the offer is entitled to all of its costs in connection with the arbitration in respect of the period from the date the offer to settle was made to the making of the arbitration award. The costs of arbitration include the arbitrators&#x27; fees and expenses, the provision of a reporter and transcripts, reasonable legal fees, and reasonable costs of preparations.</p><p>(f) Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction or application may be made to the Court for judicial recognition of the award or an order of enforcement, as the case may be.</p><p>(g) All disputes referred to arbitration (including the scope of the agreement to arbitrate, any statute of limitations, set-off claims, conflict of laws, rules, tort claims, and interest claims) are governed by the law of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable in the Province of Ontario.</p><p>(h) The parties to the dispute agree that the arbitration will be kept confidential and that the existence of the proceeding and any element of it (including any pleadings, briefs or other documents submitted or exchanged, any testimony or other oral Materials, and any awards) may not be disclosed beyond the arbitrator, the parties, their counsel and any person necessary to the conduct of the proceeding, except as may lawfully be required in judicial proceedings relating to the arbitration or otherwise or as may be required by applicable law or the rules of any applicable stock exchange.</p><p>(i) Unless otherwise required by the arbitration tribunal, you agree with Figment that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written Materials (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator&#x27;s rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_WYt5" id="82-no-class-actions">8.2 No Class Actions<a class="hash-link" href="#82-no-class-actions" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can&#x27;t combine multiple people&#x27;s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an arbitrator&#x27;s decision or award in one person&#x27;s case can only impact that person, not other people, and can&#x27;t be used to decide other people&#x27;s disputes.
