## **#**

**51% Attack**

It’s also known as Majority Attack. When a miner or group of miners controls more than 50% of the mining power of the network then that group can disrupt the network’s mining process and can manipulate the network.

## A

**Address**

An address is used to identify private key holders when transferring value.

**Airdrop**

It's the process of distributing digital assets to the public. Just like transferring some tokens to users' wallet addresses. Nowadays companies use it as a marketing strategy.

**Altcoin**

Altcoins refers to cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin.

**Archive Node**

An archive node stores everything kept in the full node but also builds an archive of historical states. They are necessary if you want to check the state of an account at any given block height.

**Attack Surface**

The Attack Surface describes all of the different points where an attacker could get into a system, and where they could get data out.

**ATOM**

The ATOM token is the native staking currency of the Cosmos Hub. Validators use the ATOM tokens to stake and secure the zones within Cosmos.

**ATH**

It stands for All-Time-High. It used to point to the highest value/price of cryptocurrencies ever reached in history.

**AVAX**

AVAX is the Avalanche network’s native asset. It has two special uses on the Avalanche network:

- Validators must stake AVAX
- Transaction fees will be paid in AVAX

---

## B

**Bitcoin**

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto which launched the era of cryptocurrencies.

**Block**

A block is a collection of several operations. The operations are located in the payload of the block which is specific to the protocol.

Along with the payload, the block includes a header that contains protocol-agnostic data. It consists of generic information such as the block predecessor’s hash and the block’s timestamp.

**Blockchain**

A blockchain is a digital, public ledger that records online transactions. Blockchain is the core technology for [cryptocurrencies](https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/c/cryptocurrency/) like [bitcoin](https://www.bankrate.com/glossary/b/bitcoin/). A blockchain ensures the integrity of a cryptocurrency by encrypting, validating, and permanently recording transactions. A blockchain is similar to a bank’s ledger but open and accessible to everyone who utilizes the cryptocurrency it supports.

**BUIDL**

Inspired or derived from HODL. A term referring to keeping your heads down and focusing on building your product.

**Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) Consensus**

**Circulating Supply**

Circulating Supply is the best approximation of the number of coins that are circulating in the market and in the general public's hands.

**Consensus Protocol**

A consensus protocol is an algorithm, or series of steps, that a set of computers follow in order to reach an agreement on some piece of information. In a payments system, for example, the computers follow a protocol to agree on who has how much money.

**Cosmos**

Cosmos is an ecosystem of blockchains that can scale and interoperate with each other. It is powered by the Cosmos Hub, the main communication channel between the Cosmos blockchains.

**Cryptocurrency**

A digital currency that is built using blockchain technology and secured by cryptography to use as a medium of peer to peer transaction. Eg. BTC, ETH etc.

**Cryptography**

Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it.

Decentralized exchanges (DEX) are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows for direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without the need of an intermediary.

**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**

A new form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on price movements on a range of assets using derivatives, trade cryptocurrencies, insure against risks, and earn interest in a savings-like account

**Double Spending**

When crypto coins are spent more than once. Mainly happens due to 51% attack.

## F

**Fiat**

Fiat money is a currency that lacks intrinsic value and is established as a legal tender by government regulation.

**Fork**

A situation where two blocks are generated pointing to the same block as their parent, and some portion of miners see one block first and some see the other. This may lead to two blockchains growing at the same time. Generally, it is mathematically near-certain that a fork will resolve itself within four blocks as miners on one chain will eventually get lucky and that chain will grow longer and all miners switch to it; however, forks may last longer if miners disagree on whether or not a particular block is valid.

**Full Node**

Mainnet is the term used to describe when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, meaning that cryptocurrency transactions are being broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a blockchain.

**Mainet Swap**

A mainnet swap occurs when a project moves from one blockchain to another. Usually, this means a project is transitioning from its testnet phase to its mainnet phase.

**Maximum Supply**

Transactions that take place on a specific blockchain network, which later grouped together before submitting them on the main blockchain.

**On-chain**

An interaction that takes place solely through a transaction being executed on the blockchain and updating the state of the ledger.

**Oracles**

For smart contracts, oracles are a middle-ware product in which data outside of the blockchain (such as real-world data from weather to stocks) is connected to it. That data is then used for conditions of smart contracts.

**Open Source Software**

Open-source software (OSS) is software that is distributed under a license with its source code, making it available for use, modification, and distribution with its original rights.

---

## P

**Peer-to-Peer**

Two or more computers are connected together without relying on any centralized server.

**Smart Digital Assets**

A smart digital asset is a digital representation of a real-world thing such as an equity, bond, money etc. They can have a complex ruleset that defines their behavior and how they are handled. This ruleset can include things like, “can’t be traded until next year,” for example.

**Stable Coin**

A stablecoin is a new class of cryptocurrencies that attempts to offer price stability and are backed by a reserve asset.

**State**

The set of data that a blockchain network strictly needs to keep track of and that represents data currently relevant to applications on the chain.

In a currency, this is simply balances; in more complex applications this could refer to other data structures that the application in question needs to keep track of (eg. who has what domain name, what is the status of a given contract, etc).

---

A UTXO is the amount of digital currency remaining after a cryptocurrency transaction is executed. UTXOs are processed continuously and are responsible for beginning and ending each transaction.

---

## V

**Validator**

A validator is a node participating in the consensus protocol. Validators work together to achieve consensus as to which transactions have taken place on a blockchain.

**Virtual Machines**

A Virtual Machine defines the application-level logic of a blockchain. In technical terms, it defines a state machine. It specifies the state that is held, the state transition function, and the transactions that clients can issue in order to query/modify the state. Developers create Virtual Machines that implements some functionality and then create a blockchain that runs the Virtual Machine. Every blockchain runs (is an instance of) a Virtual Machine.

---

**Wallet**

An app that allows a user to manage an account, and usually stores the associated private key.

**Wrapped Token**

A wrapped token is an asset hosted on the Ethereum blockchain with a price that is the same as another underlying asset, even if it's not on the same blockchain or on a blockchain at all.

---

## Z
