The Cosmos Undelegate flow allows you to unstake your ATOM tokens from the validator. With the Staking API, you can unstake your ATOM tokens within a few steps.

To unstake ATOM tokens, you will need:

- The `delegator_address` from which ATOM was delegated, which will sign the transaction.
- The `validator_address` from which ATOM is being undelegated.
- The `amount` of ATOM to be undelegated.
- An optional `memo`.
- An optional `gas_limit` and `gas_price` in ATOM.
- The `pubkey` (public key) of the `delegator_address`.

Follow the steps in this section for the details on this process.
