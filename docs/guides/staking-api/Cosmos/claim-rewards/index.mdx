The Cosmos claim rewards flow allows you to withdraw your staking rewards in a very easy way.

To claim rewards paid in ATOM tokens, you will need:

- The `delegator_address` from which ATOM was delegated, which will sign the transaction.
- The `validator_addresses` from which you want to withdraw the staking rewards.
- An optional `memo`.
- An optional `gas_limit` and `gas_price` in ATOM.
- The `pubkey` (public key) of the `delegator_address`.

Follow the steps in this section for the details on this process.
