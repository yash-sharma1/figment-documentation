title: Create New Split Stake Account Flow
slug: /guides/staking-api/solana/split-stake-account/create-new-flow
---

To initiate the split stake account process with the Staking API, create a new flow with a `POST` request to `/api/v1/flows`.

### Parameters

- `flow` &mdash; `object`
  - `network_code` &mdash; `string` Network on which this flow operates (ex. `solana`) (required).
  - `chain_code` &mdash; `string` Chain on which this flow operates (ex. `testnet`) (required).
  - `operation` `string` The operation to perform (ex. `split_stake_account`) (required).
  - `version` &mdash; `string` API version to use (ex. `v1`) (optional).

#### Sample cURL Request

```bash {5-10}
curl -X POST 'https://solana-slate.datahub.figment.io/api/v1/flows' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: <api_key>' \
-d '{
  "flow": {
    "network_code": "solana",
    "chain_code": "testnet",
    "operation": "split_stake_account",
    "version": "v1"
  }
}'
```

### Response

- `id` &mdash; `string` ID of the newly created flow.
- `state` &mdash; `string` The current state of the flow.

The response indicates one possible `action`:

- `create_split_tx` &mdash; Use this Action to create a split stake account transaction.

The `create_split_tx` action indicates three fields for data collection:

- `funding_account_pubkey` &mdash; The public key of the wallet which will pay the transaction fee.
- `source_stake_account_pubkey` &mdash; The existing stake account from which partial SOL balance will be split.
- `amount` &mdash; The amount of SOL to be transferred to a newly created stake account. This field should be in full SOL, not in lamports (ie. if you want to transfer 5 SOL, return `"amount": 5.0`). The Staking API will translate the amount to lamports so you do not have to worry about the conversion factor. Lamports are fractional SOLs.
