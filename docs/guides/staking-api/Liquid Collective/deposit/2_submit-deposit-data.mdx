After collecting the required inputs, send a `PUT` request to `/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` to proceed to the next step.

### Parameters

- `name` &mdash; `string` Name of the action to execute (required).
- `inputs` &mdash; `object`
  - `depositor_address` &mdash; The main wallet ETH will be originating from (required).
  - `amount` &mdash; The number of ETH to be staked, in Ether (required).
  - `gas_limit` &mdash; The maximum number of gwei you're willing to pay as a fee for this transaction (optional).
  - `gas_price` &mdash; The current required gas for sending a transaction on Ethereum (optional).

### Sample cURL Request

```bash {5-10}
// TBA
```

:::info note
You may leave off `gas_limit` and `gas_price` if you'd like to use default values supplied by our Ethereum node.

Also, at this stage, if your `depositor_address` does not have permission to deposit on the Liquid Collective address, you will see a `422` for an invalid address:

```bash
{
    "code": "invalid",
    "message": "Request could not be processed due to validation errors!",
    "errors": {
        "depositor_address": [
            {
                "code": "invalid",
                "message": "is invalid",
                "context": {}
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

:::

### Response

The response indicates two possible `actions`:

- `refresh_deposit_tx` &mdash; If you need to get a fresh version of the transaction payload (for example, if the nonce needs to be updated).
- `sign_deposit_tx` &mdash; Submit a signed transaction Payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

We will choose `sign_deposit_tx`, which indicates one input to collect:

- `transaction_payload` &mdash; The signed transaction payload ready to be broadcast to the network.

#### Sample Response

```json {19}
// TBA
```

:::info note

Make sure to save the `transaction_payload` from this response, which is what needs to be signed in the next step.
