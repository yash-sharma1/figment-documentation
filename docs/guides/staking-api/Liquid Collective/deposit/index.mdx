Depositing ETH into Liquid Collective requires interacting with the on-chain Liquid Collective contracts. Our interaction will consist of two calls:

1. A call to the Liquid Collective contract, to determine if your depositor address has the necessary permissions to deposit.
2. A call to the Deposit contract that will send ETH, stake it, and give you back a liquid staking asset, LsETH.

Both interactions are handled by Staking API in one flow. Next steps illustrate how to supply the necessary parameters for Staking API to execute these two calls.
