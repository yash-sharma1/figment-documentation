Sign the deposit transaction using the `transaction_payload` you received in response to submitting the deposit data.

Locate the `transaction_payload` in the response from the previous step. It will look something like this:

```json
"transaction_payload": "// TBA"
```

:::caution important

Always confirm the details of the transaction before signing the payload.

Figment has a tool for signing and decoding Staking API payloads, see the guide [Signing Transactions with Figment's npm Package](/guides/staking-api/figment-signing-transactions) to continue.

:::

Transactions can also be signed using [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/signer/) or [Fireblocks](/guides/staking-api/fireblocks-signing-transactions).

Sign the transaction and move on to the next step. A signed transaction payload for Ethereum will look something like this:

```text
// TBA
```
