slug: /guides/staking-api/liquid-collective/deposit/submit-signed-deposit-transaction
---

After signing the transaction, send a `PUT` request to `/api/v1/flows/[:flow_id]/next` with the signed payload.
The Staking API will broadcast the transaction to the Ethereum network.

### Parameters

- `name` &mdash; `string` Name of the action to execute (required).
- `inputs` &mdash; `object`
  - `transaction_payload` &mdash; Signed transaction payload from the previous step's response.

#### Sample cURL Request

```bash {5-8}
// TBA
```

### Response

With the signed transaction provided, the Staking API will broadcast it to the network. As the transaction progresses towards confirmation, the returned state will be either:

- `deposit_tx_broadcasting` &mdash; Transaction has been broadcast and is awaiting confirmation.
- `completed` &mdash; Transaction has been confirmed and deposit is complete.

#### Sample Response

```json {3}
// TBA
```
