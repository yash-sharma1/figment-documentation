For the purposes of creating a proxy account that Figment can use on a nominator’s
behalf, customers must create a new account on Polkadot.js to be used as a proxy.
Once a nominator has created this account, they will back up the account as a `.json` file
or mnemonic, then send the account information along with the access password in order for
Figment to operate the account.

:::caution important

The creation of this account will not compromise a nominator’s tokens,
as those are held within the stash account operated by the
controller that holds their proxy list - the staking proxy will not have the power to do
anything other than nominate with the account, and a nominator can delete the proxy at
any time.

:::

### Required DOT For Deposit and Transactions

In order for a Controller to have a proxy list, the Controller must have a
`ProxyDepositBase` of 20.008 DOT, in addition to the product of `ProxyDepositFactors` (.033 DOT)
multiplied by the number of accounts that will be included on the proxy list.

Each proxy account must hold a small deposit in order to execute transactions.
Transaction fees are measured in milliDOTs, so a small balance of around 5 DOT should be sufficient for the lifetime of transactions on the account.

:::caution important

When deleting a proxy account, the deposit will be returned to the Controller account.

Refer to the Polkadot documentation on <Link to="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-proxies#removing-proxy">Removing Proxy</Link> for more information.

For specifics on removing proxy rights via the Staking API, refer to our guide: <Link to="/guides/staking-api/remove-staking-proxy">Remove a Staking Proxy</Link>.

## Creating a Staking Proxy Account in polkadot.js

1. Go to <Link to="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts">https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts</Link> and click **Add account**.
2. Follow the given steps to add the account.
3. Once you have added the account, you will still need to set it as a proxy on your Controller account. Do this by clicking on the account menu in polkadot.js (three vertical dots on the right side of the UI) and selecting **Add proxy**.

4. The **Proxied account** must be your Controller account - the **Proxy account** will be the account you just added to polkadot.js for this purpose. Set the type of the account to **Staking** as well. Once you have confirmed the details, click **Submit**.

5. You can verify that the proxy has been created by checking the accounts list in polkadot.js. You can click on **Proxy overview** to see details.

6. When you added the account to polkadot.js, you should receive a password protected `.json` file. Below is an example of what the file looks like.
   This file, along with the password you set when making the account, must be sent to <Link to="mailto:staking@figment.io">staking@figment.io</Link> with a request to implement this staking proxy. The Figment team will then operate this proxy to make validator nominations on your behalf, maximizing your staking rewards.

- If for any reason you did not receive this file, you can create a new backup from the account options in the polkadot.js UI.
