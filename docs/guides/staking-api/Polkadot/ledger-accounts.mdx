This guide describes how to set up and use the polkadot.js app with your Ledger device to access your Ledger Polkadot (DOT) accounts and add a proxy which allows Figment to manage your DOT nominations.

In the following steps, we will illustrate how to use a Ledger to manage a proxy account.

## Prerequisites

- A supported Ledger device is required.
- Complete any pending Metadata updates in the <Link to="https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/settings/metadata">polkadot.js Settings</Link>.
- Make sure you're using the most recent version of the Polkadot app on your Ledger device.
- Ensure that you have the necessary amount of DOT when making the proxy.
  - Refer to <Link to="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-proxies#proxy-deposits">Proxy Deposits</Link> on the Polkadot Wiki for more information.

## Add Additional Ledger DOT Accounts

If you need or already have multiple Polkadot accounts, follow the steps below to add them manually:

1. Select **Add via Ledger**.
2. In the **Name** field, choose a unique name for your account.
3. In the **Account type** field, choose **Account type 1**. Leave the address index field on the default 0 value.
4. Click **Save**.

Your second DOT account should now show up next to your first account in polkadot.js.
For additional accounts, follow the same steps but increment the **Account type** value &mdash; using Account type 2, etc.
