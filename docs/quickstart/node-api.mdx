:::info

After creating your app, you can immediately use the Figment APIs.

The following sections explain accessing the APIs.

:::

> The Node APIs are used to communicate with nodes running on a given blockchain protocol. For example, if you want to get information about a specific block on Polygon, you can send a request to the Polygon endpoint to run the method `eth_getBlockByNumber`&mdash;which returns a JSON object containing the data you have requested.

You can see the endpoint URLs on the protocol's detail page:

1. From the Dashboard, select your app. Choose the **Overview** tab. Click on the protocol you want to access.
2. On the protocol's detail page, you can see a list of all available services and networks for that protocol on the right side of the page. Next to each endpoint URL is a link to an example.
3. From the example, you can see the full URL for this service as well as some sample requests to get you started.

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you can pass your API key as an [Authorization](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Authorization) header.

You must also have an [Allowed Origin](settings-and-security#allowed-origins) set in your DataHub app, if your app makes any cross-origin requests.

:::warning

To maintain the security of your API keys, we recommend always using [**HTTPS**](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/learning/ssl/what-is-https/).

Keep in mind that API keys sent over **HTTP** are insecure, regardless of the method used.

:::

#### Example Requests

:::info

In example requests, the text `API-KEY` must be replaced with your actual credentials for it to function. Similarly, you would need to replace the _value_ of the constant `API_KEY` in any code examples.
